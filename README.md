# Flight-Delay-Predictive-Analysis

### Introduction
The history of transportation is a tale of human ingenuity, evolving from the simplicity of foot travel to the complexity of modern air travel. As we navigate this fast-paced world, efficiency and time management have become paramount, making air travel an essential mode of transportation. However, with the increasing reliance on flights, the issue of flight delays has become a significant concern. While some delays are unavoidable due to factors like weather or air traffic congestion, the potential to predict these delays could revolutionize the travel experience.

In this project, we explore the power of predictive analytics and machine learning to forecast airline flight delays. By analyzing historical data, weather patterns, and air traffic information, we aim to develop a model capable of predicting delays with high accuracy. Such a tool would not only help passengers manage their travel plans more effectively but also enable airlines to optimize their operations, reducing the overall impact of delays.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the frequent air travel in today's world, where delays are a common occurrence due to various factors. Our goal is to create a forecasting model that can predict potential delays, empowering travelers to make informed decisions and consider alternative options. This proactive approach seeks to enhance the reliability of air travel, making it a smoother and more predictable experience.

### Key Questions Addressed
- Is there a correlation between months and flight delays due to weather?
- Are specific days or times more prone to delays?
- How do delays vary across different months, and which airlines are most affected by weather-related delays?
- How do temperature and geographical location influence delays?

### Conclusion
Humanity's journey from the invention of the wheel to the development of spacecraft illustrates remarkable progress in transportation technologies. In today’s fast-paced world, where aviation is a preferred mode of travel, challenges such as flight delays remain significant. This project reveals that weather delays, accounting for 83.5% of all delays, are particularly influential, with temperature playing a crucial role. Analysis indicates that delays are not only tied to colder temperatures but also to warm conditions, challenging the traditional belief that cold weather is the primary cause of delays.

Unsupervised machine learning techniques like Association Rule Mining (ARM) uncovered patterns showing that warmer temperatures, along with airlines like Southwest and Spirit, and states like Florida and Illinois, experience higher frequencies of delays. The predictive models developed, although not fully effective in their current form, suggest the need for a more comprehensive approach that includes additional meteorological factors such as humidity, dew point, and wind speed.

Future improvements could involve integrating more complex models like neural networks to capture intricate relationships between various factors. By continuing research and refining these models, the dream of accurately predicting flight delays and minimizing their impact on travelers could soon become a reality, benefiting both passengers and airlines alike.
